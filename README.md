Air Quality Sensor mod

I got hold of this sensor for monitoring air quality.
After days of testing, I found that it worked well for home use, well beyond expectations.
Thus was born the idea of ​​being able to interface it with home automation.
After careful analysis, I deduce that the sensor is managed by a single integrated circuit that takes the information from the two sensors, makes it "readable" and writes it on the display.
Unfortunately, it seems to me that this integrated circuit does not have the possibility of being interfaced.
Furthermore, there is nothing on board that has to do with wifi.

I describe in detail what I deduced from the analysis of the components and the article in general.
